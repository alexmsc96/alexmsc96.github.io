    <h1>All about me</h1>
    <p>Hello, world! My name is Jen. I live in Boston. Minneapolis is awesome</p>

    <p>Here is a picture of a kitten. Because my page is boring without a photo</p>

    <p>One of my hobbies is playing the flute. I play in a orchestra back in Boston. We have a concert coming up on November 11.</p>
